# Radiochromic Toolbox

Welcome to the Radiochromic Toolbox repository! This project, developed within
the Octave/MATLAB environment, offers a comprehensive set of classes and
functions tailored for the manipulation and analysis of radiochromic film scans.

## Overview

The Radiochromic Toolbox is designed to streamline the process of handling
radiochromic film scans and to ensure efficient extraction of the dosimetry data
from film scans.

## Features

This is a sample list of features:
- **Image Preprocessing:** Prepare radiochromic film scans for analysis by
applying filters, noise reduction techniques, and enhancing image quality.

- **Data Extraction:** Extract essential data points from the scans, including
dose profiles, dose maps, and spatial calibration information.

- **Dose Profile Computation:** Compute detailed dose profiles to visualize the
distribution of radiation doses across the film.

- **Spatial Calibration:** Accurately calibrate the spatial dimensions of the
film scans, ensuring precise measurements and analyses.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The toolbox is designed with an intuitive
interface, allowing easy integration into your existing workflow.

## Installation

1. Clone the OctaveMatlabPlayground repository to your local machine.
 ```
 git clone git@github.com:kurijlj/OctaveMatlabPlayground.git
 ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
 ```
 cd './Radiochromic Toolbox'
 ```

3. Launch Octave/MATLAB and navigate to the toolbox folder. Invoke tool scripts.

## Usage

These are sample usage steps:
1. Import your radiochromic film scan into the toolbox.

2. Utilize the provided functions and classes to preprocess, extract data,
compute dose profiles, and calibrate spatial dimensions.

3. Visualize and analyze the results, gaining valuable insights for quality
control and treatment optimization.
