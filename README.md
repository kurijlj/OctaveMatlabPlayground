# Octave Playground

Welcome to the OctaveMATLAB Playground repository! ðŸŽ‰ This is a collection of
small Octave/Matlab projects that might not warrant individual repositories but
are still valuable and interesting to keep.

## Introduction

This repository aims to be a home for your coding experiments, algorithm
explorations, visualization tricks, and more built up over the years. Whether
it's a tiny tool, a clever function, or a short script, they all have a place
here in the Octave Playground.

## Projects

- **FoV Elements:** This project oontains a collection of algorithms and
functions that focus on various aspects of working with Field of View (FoV)
manipulation and analysis. The primary objectives of this project is to explore
algorithm for generating computational FoV, algorithm for positioning and
resizing of an ROI to fit the given FoV, algorithm for calculating the binary
mask out of the given ROI in respect to given FoV, algorithm for plotting of an
ROI on given axes, and to provide a comprehensive test suite that covers all the
aforementioned algorithms. For more details check the 'README.md' file provided
in the project directory.

## Getting Started

To start exploring the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using
the following command:
 ```
 git clone git@github.com:kurijlj/OctaveMatlabPlayground.git
 ```

2. **Navigate to a Project:** Browse the `projects` directory to find the
projects that interest you. Each project is contained within its own directory.

3. **Run the Code:** Follow the instructions provided in the project's
'README.md' file to set up and run the Octave code.

4. **Experiment and Learn:** Tinker with the code, modify parameters, and see
the effects. Learn by experimentation and observation.
